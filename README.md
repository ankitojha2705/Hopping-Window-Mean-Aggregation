# Hopping Window Mean Aggregation

This project demonstrates a hopping window mean aggregation on time series data generated by a simulated sensor. The sensor system generates readings every hour, and a hopping window function is applied to calculate the average sensor reading over a sliding time frame, helping to increase throughput and reduce latency.


## Introduction
The hopping window mean aggregation technique is commonly used in distributed environments to process high-frequency time series data. In this example, we use a 3-hour window that hops every 1 hour to calculate the mean sensor readings over time, providing a smoother representation of the data for real-time analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `docx` (for generating reports)

## Methodology
1. **Data Generation**: Simulated sensor data with timestamps every hour for a total of 100 periods. Each reading is a random integer value between 1 and 10.
2. **Hopping Window Parameters**: A 3-hour window size with a 1-hour hop interval. This configuration means each window averages data over a 3-hour span and moves forward by 1 hour.
3. **Mean Calculation**: The mean value is calculated for each window, and results are stored in a new column, `hopping_mean`.
4. **Visualization**: The original sensor readings and the hopping mean values are plotted to visually demonstrate the aggregation effect.

## Results
The graph below (generated in the project code) compares the original sensor readings with the hopping mean values. The hopping mean provides a smooth representation of the data, allowing for better insights into trends in high-frequency time series data.
